Max works as Distinguished Engineer at Red Hat, currently as part of the Quarkus team focusing on Developer joy. 

Developer joy plays a central part of Max’s 15+ years of experience as a professional open-source contributor. Max worked on Hibernate/Hibernate Tools, WildFly, Seam, and Ceylon. Max led the team behind JBoss Tools and Developer Studio until starting work on Quarkus.

Quarkus being a Kubernetes native stack keeps Max busy ensuring developers still experience joy deploying Quarkus applications to Kubernetes platforms like OpenShift.

Max has a keen interest in moving the Java ecosystem forward and making it more accessible.
To that end he created https://jbang.dev[JBang] a tool to bring back developer joy to Java and works closely with teams defining and exploring making native image for Java a reality using GraalVM/Mandrel, Leyden and Quarkus.

Max also co-hosts the weekly video podcast called https://quarkus.io/insights[Quarkus Insights] and he can be found on twitter as https://twitter.com/@maxandersen[@maxandersen]

Illusion of Hype (2025-06-09)::
Apple&#8217;s recent paper, The Illusion of Thinking, has sparked a wave of discussions both online and offline. Some have latched onto it as a definitive "gotcha" moment against large language models (LLMs), claiming they&#8217;re nothing but fancy statistical engines that can&#8217;t truly reason. But here’s the thing: we already should know that. Anyone who’s spent time digging into how LLMs work knows they’re built from neural networks, statistics, and sheer compute horsepower. There’s no magic “thinking” happening under the hood, no matter how many times a CEO stands on a stage and calls them “intelligent.” And yet — that doesn’t make them any less impressive or useful....

Quarkus MCP Server: The First Java Server SDK to Support Streamable HTTP! (2025-05-23)::
<div class="paragraph"><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is taking the developer world by storm, and now, with its latest spec update: Streamable HTTP support has arrived!</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>We&#8217;re thrilled to announce that Quarkus MCP Server is the very first Java-based MCP server SDK to embrace this innovation, making it easier than ever for you to build, experiment, and deploy MCP-powered solutions—wherever you need them.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><a href="https://github.com/quarkiverse/quarkus-mcp-server/releases/tag/1.2.0">Quarkus MCP Server 1.2</a> now supports Streamable HTTP alongside <code>stdio</code> and <code>SSE</code> transports. This enables new possibilities for connecting your MCP servers to mobile apps and cloud services. While the implementation is fully functional, some advanced features like <a href="https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#resumability-and-redelivery">Resumability and Redelivery</a> are planned for future releases.</p></div><div class="sect1"><h2 id="why-streamable-http-matters"><a class="anchor" href="#why-streamable-http-matters"></a>Why Streamable HTTP Matters</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>Streamable HTTP is the approach MCP spec have taken for real-time, efficient, and scalable communication between clients and servers. It opens the door to new integrations and user experiences, especially for platforms and devices where traditional transports like SSE or stdio aren&#8217;t ideal.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>And now, thanks to Quarkus MCP Server, Java developers are at the forefront of this evolution. Whether you&#8217;re building AI assistants, developer tools, or next-gen chatbots, Streamable HTTP gives you the flexibility to reach more users, faster.</p></div></div></div><div class="sect1"><h2 id="easy-upgrade"><a class="anchor" href="#easy-upgrade"></a>Easy upgrade</h2><div class="sectionbody"><div class="paragraph"><p>Ready to try it out?

Simplifying JDBC Connections with JBang: Introducing the ‘jdbc’ Script (2023-11-01)::
Introduction Hello, Java enthusiasts! Today, I&#8217;m excited to share a tool that I believe will make your database interactions much simpler. If you&#8217;ve worked with Java databases, you know that setting up JDBC connections can sometimes be a bit cumbersome. That&#8217;s where my JBang script, conveniently named jdbc, comes into play. It&#8217;s designed to streamline the process, making your life as a developer a bit easier....

Emperors New Clothes (2024-10-21)::
Once upon a time, in a world not too distant from our own, a great invention was unveiled: the “Intelligent Machine,” or simply "AI." Its creators promised wonders—unlimited reasoning, flawless decision-making, and the power to revolutionize industries. It was said that this new technology could think like a human, solve problems beyond human capability, and would soon render manual labor, tedious management, and even complex tasks obsolete. The leaders of the world—CEOs, politicians, and influencers—were enchanted. "This is the future," they declared. "AI will guide us to new heights of productivity, efficiency, and innovation." The tech CEOs, drunk on the promise of reducing costs, began to replace workers with AI-powered systems. Programmers were let go, customer support became fully automated, and entire departments were dissolved as the AI took their place. The AI was hailed as the ultimate solution to every problem. Businesses bragged about their "AI-driven" strategies, while governments boasted about using AI to streamline services. Investors poured in their wealth, driving the AI bubble higher and higher. Society was caught in the frenzy, trusting AI to steer the ship, no longer caring to question its methods....

Quarkus & Red Hat's evolving middleware strategy (2025-03-13)::
<div class="paragraph"><p>Over the past weeks, we&#8217;ve received questions about the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/evolving-our-middleware-strategy">recent announcement</a> that Red Hat&#8217;s Middleware engineering and product teams, which include Quarkus, are moving to IBM.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>We want to take this opportunity to acknowledge this change while reaffirming what has always been true:</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>Quarkus is an open-source project driven by a global community of contributors, spanning companies, individuals, and open-source enthusiasts.</strong></p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>From its inception, Quarkus has been shaped by <strong>real-world adoption</strong> across industries, with companies <a href="https://quarkus.io/userstories/">sharing their user-stories</a>, leveraging Quarkus&#8217;s unmatched performance and developer joy in the Java ecosystem. We recently celebrated our <a href="https://quarkus.io/1000contributors/"><strong>1000th contributor milestone</strong></a>, a testament to the strength of this diverse and thriving community.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Speaking as Quarkus contributors employed by Red Hat and soon IBM, we love our project and intend to keep making it awesome. IBM and Red Hat have clearly communicated that the current and future contributions to Quarkus are a key component of the middleware strategy. IBM has already been an active contributor to Quarkus, and we look forward to increased contribution - alongside the many other individuals and companies who contribute, innovate, and drive Quarkus forward.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>Additionally, <strong>Quarkus is already on the path to becoming part of <a href="https://www.commonhaus.org/">Commonhaus</a> an open-source foundation</strong>, further ensuring its long-term independence and success as a truly community-driven project. The move to the foundation and the Red Hat/IBM move could look suspicious timing-wise, but the two are unrelated. We described our reasons in a <a href="https://quarkus.io/blog/quarkus-in-a-foundation/">previous blog post</a>, but if anything, this announcement reaffirms the importance of a foundation-hosted project for its stability.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p>To our contributors and users: your involvement has always been what makes Quarkus thrive. Keep building, experimenting, and shaping the future of Java with us.</p></div><div class="paragraph"><p><strong>-- The Quarkus Team</strong></p></div>...
