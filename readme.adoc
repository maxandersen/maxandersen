Max works as Distinguished Engineer at Red Hat, currently as part of the Quarkus team focusing on Developer joy. 

Developer joy plays a central part of Max’s 15+ years of experience as a professional open-source contributor. Max worked on Hibernate/Hibernate Tools, WildFly, Seam, and Ceylon. Max led the team behind JBoss Tools and Developer Studio until starting work on Quarkus.

Quarkus being a Kubernetes native stack keeps Max busy ensuring developers still experience joy deploying Quarkus applications to Kubernetes platforms like OpenShift.

Max has a keen interest in moving the Java ecosystem forward and making it more accessible.
To that end he created https://jbang.dev[JBang] a tool to bring back developer joy to Java and works closely with teams defining and exploring making native image for Java a reality using GraalVM/Mandrel, Leyden and Quarkus.

Max also co-hosts the weekly video podcast called https://quarkus.io/insights[Quarkus Insights] and he can be found on twitter as https://twitter.com/@maxandersen[@maxandersen]
