Max works as Distinguished Engineer at Red Hat, currently as part of the Quarkus team focusing on Developer joy. 

Developer joy plays a central part of Max’s 15+ years of experience as a professional open-source contributor. Max worked on Hibernate/Hibernate Tools, WildFly, Seam, and Ceylon. Max led the team behind JBoss Tools and Developer Studio until starting work on Quarkus.

Quarkus being a Kubernetes native stack keeps Max busy ensuring developers still experience joy deploying Quarkus applications to Kubernetes platforms like OpenShift.

Max has a keen interest in moving the Java ecosystem forward and making it more accessible.
To that end he created https://jbang.dev[JBang] a tool to bring back developer joy to Java and works closely with teams defining and exploring making native image for Java a reality using GraalVM/Mandrel, Leyden and Quarkus.

Max also co-hosts the weekly video podcast called https://quarkus.io/insights[Quarkus Insights] and he can be found on twitter as https://twitter.com/@maxandersen[@maxandersen]

Illusion of Hype (2025-06-09)::
Apple&#8217;s recent paper, The Illusion of Thinking, has sparked a wave of discussions both online and offline. Some have latched onto it as a definitive "gotcha" moment against large language models (LLMs), claiming they&#8217;re nothing but fancy statistical engines that can&#8217;t truly reason. But here’s the thing: we already should know that. Anyone who’s spent time digging into how LLMs work knows they’re built from neural networks, statistics, and sheer compute horsepower. There’s no magic “thinking” happening under the hood, no matter how many times a CEO stands on a stage and calls them “intelligent.” And yet — that doesn’t make them any less impressive or useful....

Emperors New Clothes (2024-10-21)::
Once upon a time, in a world not too distant from our own, a great invention was unveiled: the “Intelligent Machine,” or simply "AI." Its creators promised wonders—unlimited reasoning, flawless decision-making, and the power to revolutionize industries. It was said that this new technology could think like a human, solve problems beyond human capability, and would soon render manual labor, tedious management, and even complex tasks obsolete. The leaders of the world—CEOs, politicians, and influencers—were enchanted. "This is the future," they declared. "AI will guide us to new heights of productivity, efficiency, and innovation." The tech CEOs, drunk on the promise of reducing costs, began to replace workers with AI-powered systems. Programmers were let go, customer support became fully automated, and entire departments were dissolved as the AI took their place. The AI was hailed as the ultimate solution to every problem. Businesses bragged about their "AI-driven" strategies, while governments boasted about using AI to streamline services. Investors poured in their wealth, driving the AI bubble higher and higher. Society was caught in the frenzy, trusting AI to steer the ship, no longer caring to question its methods....
