...or at least thats how it was originally.

I saw a https://blog.frankel.ch/customizing-github-profile/1/[blog from Frankel] where he setup a script to automatically update his profile via scripting - I thought that could be fun replicating using https://jbang.dev.

Thats what this repo is - follows same principles as Frankel just simplified where I could.
