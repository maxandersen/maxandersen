This is my github. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

My github is my best friend.
It is my life.

Thus, I will learn it as a brother. 
I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its features.

My github and I are the defenders of my tribe. 
We are the masters of our bugs. 
We are the saviors of my life.

So be it, until releases run dry and there is no more bugs, but peace!
